## Project Ares Payment App

This project showcases a use case of the payworks platform -- accepting payments with a card reader straight from a web shop!

The project features 2 components

1. The Web shop, which the merchant uses to initiate a transaction.

2. The Payment app, which takes over the payment once it is started.

The Web shop starts the payment app from the browser, which makes use of the [payworks Pay Button][1] to process card payments using a card reader.

We trigger the native payment app using deep-linking. In this project we talk about how we do this on Android.

For a simple overview on how the integrate the Payment App with your Web shop, click [here][3].


Payment App
---------------------------

The Web shop starts the payment app through a predefined URI scheme. The application can intercept this by registering an `<intent-filter>` with the required `scheme` for an Activity that can react to it.
Ã‚
The Activity in the `AndroidMainfest.xml` is defined like this:

```xml
<activity
  android:name=".AresDeepLinkActivity"
  android:autoRemoveFromRecents="true"
  android:launchMode="singleInstance"
  android:noHistory="true"
  android:theme="@android:style/Theme.NoDisplay" >
    <intent-filter>
      <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
      <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
      <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
      <data android:scheme="payworks" />
    </intent-filter>
</activity>
```

**AresDeepLinkActivity** here reacts to the URI scheme `payworks://`. The `<action>` and `<category>` tags for the  `<intent-filter>` are required as shown above in order to send the intent with the URI to the Activity.

Here, we use the following URI with the `payworks://` scheme:

```
payworks://transaction/charge?sessionIdentifier=zxcv1234
                             &providerMode=TEST
                             &accessoryFamily=MIURA_MPI
                             &merchantIdentifier=asdf1234
                             &merchantSecretKey=qwer1234
```

We get the URI in our Activity through an Intent.
```java
  Uri deepLinkUri = getIntent().getData();
```

We then extract the required parameters from the URI and start the transaction with the Pay Button SDK. Refer to the  **AresDeepLinkActivity** on how we do this.

**Note:**

We have the following attributes for the AresDeepLinkActivity:

1. `android:autoRemoveFromRecents="true"` - To prevent this from appearing in the multitasking screen. Starting the activity from the multitasking screen triggers an old Intent and also the activity must not be restartable without a scheme.

2. `android:launchMode="singleInstance"` `android:noHistory="true"` `android:finishOnTaskLaunch="true"` - To only have a single instance of the Activity and prevent triggering multiple instances of the same Activity.
